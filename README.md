# Matisse

# Getting Started with Matisse, a Matlab Toolbox for the analysis of In Situ Sequencing experiments

## Description
The Matlab Analysis Toolbox for Spatially resolved transcriptomics aims to provide an easy to use tool for performing a initial analyis for spot-based technologies in the field of Spatially-resolved transcriptomics, with focus on In Situ Sequencing experiments. Currently it is design to be able to analyze both non-segmented and segmented datasets, following this structure:

# System Requirements
The toolbox requires two add-ons: Image Processing Toolbox, Paralel Computing Toolbox and Bioinformatics Toolbox. The toobox as been tested in MATLAB R2019a and R2019b using Windows. 

# Examples
Several examples of the use of the toolbox can be found in the folder '\Examples' . Please take as a reference MATISSE_EXAMPLE_mousebrain.mlx to start your analysis.
