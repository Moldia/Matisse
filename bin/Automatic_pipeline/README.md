# Usage of Automatic Pipeline
The automatic Pipeline has been developed to automatically process data obtained directly from microscopes and tranform it into spatially resolved expression maps. 
In order to process the data, a single script called 'Next_pipeline_beta.m' is needed. All parameters need to be modified inside this script. 

# Files and folders
- **Next_pipleine_beta.m**: contains the main script needed to process the data
- **lib**: contains the functions needed to run the automatic pipeline. Note that, despite being called the same way, some functions here are not the same as in in_situ_seq or iss-analysis repository. 

# Important information
The automatic pipeline is nowadays in a beta version. Therefore, if any there is any error during the processing, please contact sergiomarco.salas@scilifelab.se
