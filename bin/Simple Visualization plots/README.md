Simple visualization plots are a set of implemented plots that may help in visualizing the expression of certain genes. It's possible to create:
- Transparent plot: plot the expression of 2 or more genes, adding transparences in order to visualize the background image
- Facet plot: plots the individuals expression of each gene in different small plots. 
- Simple plot all: plots all the genes together in a background image
- Plot on density: allow to plot based on density
