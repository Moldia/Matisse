# Standard Pipeline
The standard pipeline includes 4 (eventually 5) steps that needs to be done:
- Z projection/Mipping, stiching and exporting tiff files
- (Optional) Aligning images
- Tiling images
- Detecting blobs
- Decoding blobs and visualizing

The scripts found here will allow you to perform all the steps after exporting the tiff files. 

For more information, please consult:
**ISS Data Processing Manual.docx**, found in Standard pipeline folder. This manual is a **preliminary version** and some important steps may not be widely explained.
