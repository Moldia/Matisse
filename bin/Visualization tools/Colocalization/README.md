#Colocalization tools
Few colocalization tools can be used for checking the colocalization of 2 or more genes:

-Search "AND" regions: search and plot regions where some specified genes co-occur

-Dissimilarity test: finds the coocurrence of genes, ploting them in a heatmap

- Find Neighbors: find the neighbors of specified genes, if desired
